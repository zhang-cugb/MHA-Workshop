iRONS (interactive Reservoir Operation Notebooks and Software) is a python package that enables the simulation, forecasting and optimisation of reservoir systems. The package includes a set of interactive notebooks that demonstrate key functionalities through practical examples, and that can be run in the Jupyter environment either locally or remotely via a web browser. 

**The core functions** *(you can find them in the Toolbox folder)*

The iRONS package provides a set of Python functions implementing typical reservoir modelling tasks, such as: estimating inflows to a reservoir, simulating operator decisions, closing the reservoir mass balance equation – in the context of both short-term forecasting and long-term predictions.

**The notebooks** *(you can find them in the Notebooks folder)*

iRONs is based on the use of interactive Jupyter Notebooks (http://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebooks is a literate programming environment that combines executable code, rich media, computational output and explanatory text in a single document. 
The notebooks included in iRONS are divided in two sections:

**A.	Knowledge transfer:** A set of simple examples to demonstrate the value of simulation and optimisation tools for water resources management – i.e. why one should use these tools in the first place. 

**B.	Implementation:** A set of workflow examples showing how to apply the iRONS functions to more complex problems such as: generating inflow forecasts through a rainfall-runoff model (including bias correcting weather forecasts); optimising release scheduling against an inflow scenario or a forecast ensemble; optimising an operating policy against time series of historical or synthetic inflows.

## Quick start

Click on the button below to open iRONS on MyBinder.org so you can run, modify and interact with the Notebooks online.

In the section **A - Knowledge transfer** you can start with the Notebook **iRONS/Notebooks/A - Knowledge transfer/1.a. Simple example of how to use Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb**

In the section **B - Implementation** you can start with the Notebook **iRONS/Notebooks/B - Implementation/1.b. Bias correction of weather forecasts.ipynb**

🚨 Note in the section **B - Implementation** the Notebook **iRONS/Notebooks/B - Implementation/1.a. Downloading ensemble weather forecasts.ipynb** can only be run locally after installing iRONS.

## Installing

To install and run iRONS locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/AndresPenuela/iRONS.git
cd iRONS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🚨 Note this installation option includes both the Toolbox and Notebooks as well the example forecast data (ECMWF forecasts netcdf files) used by the Notebooks in the section **B - Implementation**.

Or you can install only the Toolbox:
```
pip install irons
```
If you get an error message try with:
```
pip install --ignore-installed irons
```
🚨 Note this installation option does NOT include the Notebooks.

If you use JupyterLab instead of Jupyter Notebooks you will need to install the following extensions:
```
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager # install the plotly extension
jupyter labextension install bqplot@0.4.6 # install the bqplot extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension # install the Jupyter widgets extension
```
